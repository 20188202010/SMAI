155,221 bags\\nof 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93\\nmln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. again it seems\\nthat cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in

estimates\\naround 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there\\nare a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,\\nmiddlemen, exporters and processors.\\n    there are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit\\nfor export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in\\nobtaining +bahia superior+ certificates.\\n    in view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have\\nsold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.\\n    comissaria smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350\\ncruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.\\n    bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and\\nonly limited sales were booked for march shipment at 1,750 to\\n1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.\\n    new crop sales were also light and all to open

of the stock\\'s recent poor\\nperformance, banking analysts said.\\n    some analysts said they have recommended bankamerica delay\\nits up to one-billion-dlr equity offering, which has yet to be\\napproved by the securities and exchange commission.\\n    bankamerica stock fell this week, along with other banking\\nissues, on the news that brazil has suspended interest payments\\non a large portion of its foreign debt.\\n    the stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon,\\nafter falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news.\\n    banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of the\\nfirst interstate bancorp <i> takeover bid gone, bankamerica is\\nunder no pressure to sell the securities into a market that\\nwill be nervous on bank stocks in the near term.\\n    bankamerica filed the offer on january 26. it was seen as\\none of the major factors leading the first interstate\\nwithdrawing its takeover bid on february 9.\\n    a bankamerica spokesman said sec approval is taking longer\\nthan expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated.\\n    \"the circumstances at the time will determine what we do,\"\\nsaid arthur miller, bankamerica\\'s vice president for financial\\ncommunications, when asked if bankamerica would proceed with\\nthe offer immediately after it receives sec approval.\\n    \"i\\'d put it off as long as they conceivably could,\" said\\nlawrence cohn, analyst with merrill lynch, pierce, fenner and\\nsmith.\\n    cohn said the longer bankamerica waits, the longer they\\nhave to show the market an improved financial outlook.\\n    although bankamerica has yet to specify the types of\\nequities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertible\\npreferred stock would encompass at least part of it.\\n    such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a\\nlower conversion price and more dilution to bankamerica stock\\nholders, noted daniel williams, analyst with sutro group.\\n    several analysts said that while they believe the brazilian\\ndebt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry\\nthrough the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely to\\nease over the coming weeks.\\n    nevertheless, bankamerica, which holds about 2.70 billion\\ndlrs in brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the\\ninterest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mln\\ndlrs if

prepared\\nby a board of the republican president\\'s own choosing.\\n    the three-member panel made up of tower, former national\\nsecurity adviser brent scowcroft and former secretary of

savaged\\nfor allegedly failing both to help reagan conduct the iran\\ninitiative and to avoid \"chaos\" in the disclosure process.\\n    casey, who underwent surgery for removal of a

over the affair.\\n    although his job approval rating has fallen as much as\\ntwenty percentage points in some opinion polls since the arms\\ndeal with iran became public last november, his personal\\npopularity is still relatively high.\\n    a los angeles times poll released earlier this week showed\\nthat just 37 pct of those surveyed thought reagan was in\\ncontrol of the government, but 55 pct still thought he was\\ndoing a good job as president.\\n    american enterprise institute analyst william schneider, a\\ndemocrat, says reagan\\'s loss of support among washington

the new\\nventure would have the support of major advertisers.\\n    peladeau, who together with family members owns about 55\\npct of quebecor, said he has recieved offers from the heads of\\ntwo

1.25 pct after\\nlast year\\'s sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985.\\n    but it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest\\nincrease in the workforce, leaving the unemployment

second half of 1986,\\nthe report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct\\nrise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct\\nrespectively in 1986.\\n    the faster growth of imports compared with exports this\\nyear and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meant\\nthat the contribution of the foreign payments balance to gdp\\nwould shrink in both years.\\n    but \"given switzerland\\'s large external surplus, there\\nshould be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than\\ngdp...which, if only in a small way, would contribute to\\nimproving international balances,\" the oecd said.\\n    real private consumption appeared to have been unusually\\nbuoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after several\\nyears of relative weakness, it noted.\\n    in 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat\\nto a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overall\\ngdp, it added.\\n    the outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained\\nbright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levels\\nlast year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation\\nin both the industry and service sectors, it said.\\n    as

a shortage of disease resistant\\nseeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance by\\nfarmers to shift from rice production to other crops, the\\nreport underlines.\\n    the fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of\\npests known as \"wereng\" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which\\nlargely offset gains in yields.\\n    the outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57\\ninsecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now\\nresistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, more\\nresistant rice types.\\n    the government is depending on

be\\nregistered with the bundesbank in the week preceding the\\ntwo-week issue period. a bank may decline to issue a bond on\\nthe requested day in the calendar, but then has to wait for the\\nnext calendar period to schedule the bond again.\\n    some managers said they would prefer to abolish the system.\\n    the bundesbank shortened the reporting period to two weeks\\nfrom four weeks last july. but few expect the calendar to be\\ncompletely abolished. \"i don\\'t think the bundesbank would give\\nthat up,\" one banking analyst said.\\n    \"i wouldn\\'t have anything against getting rid of the system,\"\\nthe analyst said, adding banks were capable of regulating the\\nvolume of new issues themselves.\\n    the bundesbank plays a passive role in setting the calendar\\nwithout trying to regulate the issues, but it needs the\\nregistration to gauge the volume of mark bonds going through\\nthe euromarket, he said.\\n    for this reason, few managers here foresee the

said.\\n    asked if these measures were being taken under pressure\\nfrom the international monetary fund (imf), boesze said: \"the\\nfund suggested it would be good to improve monetary results,\\nand of course the fund would support these efforts.\"\\n    imf teams spent several weeks in budapest late last year.\\n    boesze said preliminary figures showed that hungary\\'s

forints\\nbecause of poor performance by state firms, which needed\\nsubsidies and tax incentives to export and earn hard currency.\\n    the exact extent and nature of savings are still under\\ndiscussion but subsidies to state enterprises -- the largest\\nbudget item -- must definitely fall, boesze said.\\n    subsidies to state firms, including grants to maintain low\\nconsumer prices, exceeded the plan by nine billion to reach 164\\nbillion forints in 1986, up from 152.9 billion in 1985.\\nparliament approved 1987 subsidies of 170 billion forints.\\n    \"i think that in

2.5 pct.\\n    the authorities had already signalled a small fall in real\\nwages for 1987, but boesze said firms will suffer severe tax\\npenalties if they award nominal rises of over one or two pct.\\n    this would mean a severe cut in living standards, as retail\\nprice inflation is forecast at seven pct after 5.3 pct in 1986.\\n    a four-month basic wage freeze expires on april 1.\\n    about 40 pct of the 1986 subsidies to state enterprises and\\n33 pct in 1985 were made to maintain low consumer prices.\\n    boesze said pure economic policy would dictate significant\\ncuts in price subsidies, but that social considerations made\\nthis difficult.\\n    but he added: \"i think ultimately we will be able to make\\ncurtailments in subsidies in this area as well.\"\\n    he said hungary plans to introduce price reform at the\\nbeginning of 1988 at the same time as personal taxation and\\nvalue added tax. the imf supports these aims.\\n    hungary introduced a bankrupcty law

discipline is\\nbeing tightened and firms may fire workers more easily.\\n    boesze said the per capita employment tax paid to the state\\nby firms was being raised this year to encourage enterprises to\\nshed labour. he gave no exact figures.\\n    istvan nagy, a senior finance ministry official responsible\\nfor drafting the bankrupcy law, told reuters last year he hoped\\nthe law would cut

so-called italian\\nmiracle is really exaggerated...foreign observers always\\noscillate in the case of italy between complete pessimism and\\nunwarranted optimism,\" says luigi spaventa, one of italy\\'s\\nleading economists and a professor at rome university.\\n    according to spaventa, these violent swings of mood have\\nbeen occurring for the last 15 years, with italy one minute\\nseen as the \"bad boy of europe\" and unable to raise a dollar and\\nthe next a worker of miracles and basking in admiration,\\n    \"i think there\\'s a lot of exaggeration...once it used to be\\nthe underground economy and all the correspondents of foreign\\nnewspapers flocked to italy to study this. that was another\\nstory about nothing - like writing about a black cat in a dark\\nroom.\"\\n    spaventa, in tune with other economists and industrialists\\nhere, stress italy\\'s recent achievements, particularly the\\ndramatic and solid recovery in the fortunes of industrial\\nenterprises, but warns that the economy is still vulnerable.\\n     profits of private sector firms such as fiat s.p.a.,\\n<fiat.m> and <ing. c. olivetti and c. s.p.a.> are booming, the\\nmajor state industries are back in the black after years of\\nlosses, inflation has nosedived and the trade and balance of\\npayments deficits have been slashed. expectations by some\\nexperts that italy is poised to replace britain as the world\\'s\\nfifth largest economy have also boosted optimism.\\n    italy itself has made it clear it is not happy with what it\\nfeels to be its second-rate status among the major\\nindustrialised countries.\\n    only this week, it angrily demanded clarification of this\\nstatus after being excluded from a meeting of finance ministers\\nfrom the group of five (g-5) - comprising the united states,\\njapan, west germany, france and britain.\\n    italy said its exclusion from the meeting violated an\\nagreement reached in tokyo last year to let italy and canada\\nattend meetings held by the five whenever discussions concerned\\nmanaging the international monetary system.\\n    but italy needs first to tackle some fundamental problems\\nstill facing its economy, economists and industrialists say.\\n    \"we must not forget that ours is still a vulnerable economy,\"\\nwarns fiat managing director cesare romiti.\\n    he says that while italy\\'s recent achievements are indeed\\ncause for satisfaction and optimism, the focus now should be on\\nthe problems still remaining rather than those already solved.\\n    the country\\'s huge state sector deficit, high unemployment\\nand a heavy dependence on imported oil are among the most\\nworrying problems, experts say.\\n    the size of the state spending deficit -- estimated at\\n109,561 billion lire in 1986 and targetted at 100,000 billion\\nlire this year -- means there is a risk inflation could spiral\\nagain, says carlo scognamiglio, head of the private luiss\\nuniversity in rome.\\n    inflation fell into single digits for the first time in a\\ndecade in september 1984 and by january this year was running\\nat 4.5 pct, but it is still not low enough to guarantee\\ninternational competiveness, economists and industrialists say.\\n    and unemployment was running at 11.6 pct nationally last\\noctober according to the latest official data.\\n    recent official data showed that of a total 2.77 million\\npeople seeking work in october 1986, almost 73 pct were aged\\nbetween 14 and 29. unemployment in the south was running at\\n17.7 pct, more than double that in the industrial north.\\n    the organisation for economic cooperation and development\\n(oecd) recently forecast that italian gross domestic product\\n(gdp) would rise rise three pct in 1987 after expanding 2.5 pct\\nin 1986. but it warned that growth was unlikely to be enough to\\ncheck rising unemployment.\\n    another problem is italy\\'s reliance on imported raw\\nmaterials. the country imports around 80 pct of its fuel needs.\\n    this factor actually worked sharply in italy\\'s favour last\\nyear, when lower energy costs helped slash the country\\'s trade\\ndeficit to 3,717 billion lire  by year end from 23,085 billion\\nlire in 1985.\\n    but economists say the improvement owes little to any\\nstructural change in the italian economy and that any reversal\\nof the trend in costs could have serious consequences.\\n    if italy truly wants to be counted among the world\\'s top\\nindustrialised nations, it also needs to tighten up stockmarket\\noperating procedures and encourage firms to supply more quality\\ninformation about their activities, economists say.\\n    italy has no controls on insider trading.\\n    the country also needs to shed its rigid capital movements\\ncontrols -- a european community directive calls for these to\\nbe dismantled by 1992 -- but this too will require a less\\nblinkered attitude and a change in traditional operating\\nprocedures, economists say.\\n    \"even today, if i wanted to invest in the tokyo bourse, i\\ndoubt i\\'d find the expertise in a brokerage firm or in banks\\nwhich would allow me to do that,\" says spaventa.\\n reuter\\n\\x03', '341': \"the bank of england said it had provided\\nthe money market with 37 mln stg assistance in the morning\\nsession. this compares with the bank's

for its own internal use,\\nnot for the open market.\\n    the problem with memory chips is that they are all based on\\nthe same, well known design standards, so they are easy to copy\\nand inexpensive to manufacture. because such large japanese\\nconglomerates as sony corp <sne>, nec corp, <nipny> matushita\\nand mitsui have their own enormous consumer and electronics\\nproduct lines, they also have a guaranteeed internal market for\\ntheir chips, so they can produce huge amounts at a very low\\ncost per unit.\\n    customized chips, however, are designed for a specific\\ncustomer, manufactured in small quantities and expensive\\nrelative to standard chips. computer markets are increasingly\\nlooking to customized chips because they are difficult to copy,\\nthus making the final product harder to clone as well.\\n    intel corp <intc>, the leading manufacturer of the\\nmicroprocessors that form the brains of most computers, alerted\\nthe industry to its intention to switch to customized chips\\nlast fall.\\n    the company, which just reported a loss for 1986, said it\\nwill spend 75 mln dlrs over the next three years to turn itself\\ninto a leading manufacturer of custom and semi-custom chips.\\n    intel joins some 275 companies already competing for a\\npiece of the customized chip business but it has an advantage\\nthat the others do not. ibm, which owns a 20 pct stake in\\nintel, has agreed to share the designs for many of the 15,000\\nchips it makes for its own use. intel will customize those\\ndesigns and sell them to others.\\n    it will also get to use ibm\\'s proprietary computer system\\nfor designing chips, considered by experts to be one of the\\nmost advanced in the world.\\n    intel\\'s success is still not guaranteed, however. industry\\nanalysts noted that it is far different to design a mass market\\nitem than a customized chip that requires a close working\\nrelationship with the customer.\\n    intel spent five years

week when ex-senator howard baker was named as\\nhis replacement, was implacably opposed to volcker and tried\\noften to undermine him.\\n    it is an open secret in washington that regan tried to\\nensure that volcker, first appointed in 1979 by president\\ncarter, will not be offered a third term by president reagan.\\n    only volcker\\'s key allies in the reagan administration,\\nvice-president george bush and treasury secretary james baker,\\nkept regan\\'s recent maneuvering at bay, the sources said.\\n    sources close to the administration say regan leaked a\\nstory, quickly shot down by others in the administration, that\\nberyl sprinkel, chairman of the council of economic advisers,\\nhad been chosen to replace volcker.\\n    but as the administration\\'s credibility was increasingly\\nunder fire, it became clear that regan\\'s power to bring about\\nsuch changes was on the wane.\\n    the sources said new white house chief of staff howard\\nbaker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the\\ntreasury department and is likely to respect his views on the\\nfed chairmanship.\\n    as a moderate republican, baker is also unlikely to share\\nthe right-wing\\'s opposition to volcker.\\n    \"this new white house is going to need all the strength it\\ncan get,\" said one source when asked about the possibility of\\nvolcker\\'s reappointment.\\n    paul volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both\\nin the united states and around the world. at a time when the\\nstability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor\\nnations are in question, volcker\\'s departure would definitely\\nundermine u.s. leadership, foreign exchange analysts say.\\n    u.s. officials say volcker works very closely with treasury\\nsecretary baker on issues like international debt and global\\neconomic cooperation.\\n    the two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate\\nthe banking industry, but recent statements by volcker, in\\nwhich he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation,\\nsignalled the politically-independent central bank is coming\\naround at least partially to the treasury position.\\n    and a recent statement by a reagan administration official\\nthat the two men saw \"exactly eye-to-eye\" on the dollar was seen\\nas an indication of baker\\'s support for the fed chairman.\\n    baker is understood to have played a key role in volcker\\'s\\nreappointment to the fed in mid-1983.\\n    the sources said baker respects volcker and when appointed\\ntreasury secretary in february 1985, he decided to ensure a\\ngood working relationship, in part because he believed the two\\nkey government economic institutions have to work closely.\\n    regan, treasury secretary during president reagan\\'s first\\nterm, was formerly head of wall street\\'s largest brokerage firm\\nmerrill lynch and came to washington determined to be america\\'s\\npre-eminent economic spokesman.\\n    he developed a deep antipathy for volcker, whose political\\nskills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets took\\nmuch more seriously.\\n    but the sources said volcker would have to be invited to\\nstay. \"is the president going to ask him? he wouldn\\'t stay\\notherwise,\" said one. \"he\\'d have to be asked,\" said stephen\\naxilrod, formerly staff director of monetary policy at the fed\\nand now vice-chairman of nikko securities co. international.\\n    otherwise, the list of potential candidates is not\\nawe-inspiring. and if volcker left this augsut, he would leave\\nbehind one of the most inexperienced fed boards in years.\\n    many analysts believe this lack of collective experience --\\nthe four sitting members were all appointed within the last\\nthree years -- is dangerous, coming at a time when the global\\neconomy is threatened by instability.\\n    an experienced successor, therefore, would seem a\\nnecessity. one widely mentioned possibility is secretary of\\nstate george shultz, whose experience as treasury secretary\\nunder preesident nixon and background as a trained economist\\nwould make him ideal.\\n    but

the\\narms-to-iran scandal, will serve a third term, sources close to\\nthe fed say.\\n    but they said that no decision on the appointment, which\\nmust be filled this august, has been taken by the white house\\nand volcker too has not made up his mind.\\n    former white house chief of staff donald regan, who\\nresigned last week when ex-senator howard baker was named as\\nhis replacement, was implacably opposed to volcker and tried\\noften to undermine him.\\n    it is an open secret in washington that regan tried to\\nensure that volcker, first appointed in 1979 by president\\ncarter, will not be offered a third term by president reagan.\\n    only volcker\\'s key allies in the reagan administration,\\nvice-president george bush and treasury secretary james baker,\\nkept regan\\'s recent maneuvering at bay, the sources said.\\n    sources close to the administration say regan leaked a\\nstory, quickly shot down by others in the administration, that\\nberyl sprinkel, chairman of the council of economic advisers,\\nhad been chosen to replace volcker.\\n    but as the administration\\'s credibility was increasingly\\nunder fire, it became clear that regan\\'s power to bring about\\nsuch changes was on the wane.\\n    the sources said new white house chief of staff howard\\nbaker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the\\ntreasury department and is likely to respect his views on the\\nfed chairmanship.\\n    as a moderate republican, baker is also unlikely to share\\nthe right-wing\\'s opposition to volcker.\\n    \"this new white house is going to need all the strength it\\ncan get,\" said one source when asked about the possibility of\\nvolcker\\'s reappointment.\\n    paul volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both\\nin the united states and around the world. at a time when the\\nstability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor\\nnations are in question, volcker\\'s departure would definitely\\nundermine u.s. leadership, foreign exchange analysts say.\\n    u.s. officials say volcker works very closely with treasury\\nsecretary baker on issues like international debt and global\\neconomic cooperation.\\n    the two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate\\nthe banking industry, but recent statements by volcker, in\\nwhich he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation,\\nsignalled the politically-independent central bank is coming\\naround at least partially to the treasury position.\\n    and a recent statement by a reagan administration official\\nthat the two men saw \"exactly eye-to-eye\" on the dollar was seen\\nas an indication of baker\\'s support for the fed chairman.\\n    baker is understood to have played a key role in volcker\\'s\\nreappointment to the fed in mid-1983.\\n    the sources said baker respects volcker and when appointed\\ntreasury secretary in february 1985, he decided to ensure a\\ngood working relationship, in part because he believed the two\\nkey government economic institutions have to work closely.\\n    regan, treasury secretary during president reagan\\'s first\\nterm, was formerly head of wall street\\'s largest brokerage firm\\nmerrill lynch and came to washington determined to be america\\'s\\npre-eminent economic spokesman.\\n    he developed a deep antipathy for volcker, whose political\\nskills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets took\\nmuch more seriously.\\n    but the sources said volcker would have to be invited to\\nstay. \"is the president going to ask him? he wouldn\\'t stay\\notherwise,\" said one. \"he\\'d have to be asked,\" said stephen\\naxilrod, formerly staff director of monetary policy at the fed\\nand now vice-chairman of nikko securities co. international.\\n    otherwise, the list of potential candidates is not\\nawe-inspiring. and if volcker left this augsut, he would leave\\nbehind one of the most inexperienced fed boards in years.\\n    many analysts believe this lack of collective experience --\\nthe four sitting members were all appointed within the last\\nthree years -- is dangerous, coming at a time when the global\\neconomy is threatened by instability.\\n    an experienced successor, therefore, would seem a\\nnecessity. one widely mentioned possibility is secretary of\\nstate george shultz, whose experience as treasury secretary\\nunder preesident nixon and background as a trained economist\\nwould make him ideal.\\n    but shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-iran\\nscandal, while vice-chairman manuel johnson is regarded at 37\\nyears old as too young for the job.\\n    other potential candidates include economist alan\\ngreenspan, frequently an informal presidential economic\\nadviser, new york fed president e. gerald corrigan, federal\\ndeposit insurance corp chairman william seidman, and sprinkel.\\n    long a regan protege, sprinkel\\'s chances may be damaged by\\nhis patron\\'s departure
